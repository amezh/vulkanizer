## About
Rendering engine prototype made with *Vulkan*. Code is written using a [simpler](https://gist.github.com/bkaradzic/2e39896bc7d8c34e042b) C++ coding style. Project requires `C++11` standard and a `x64` system. Currently the code is tested only on `Windows`, using `MSVC` (Visual Studio) and `MINGW` (Visual Studio Code) compilers, but the `Linux` is not completely supported yet.

## Installation
This project uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) as a build tool. Since the project is built using `Vulkan`, the latest [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com) should be installed.
